# 10. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) Token-Based Authentication:
    When a user registers or logs into your website, the authentication process involves generating a JWT (JSON Web Token).After successful authentication, the JWT is issued to the user as a means of identifying and authenticating them for subsequent requests.The JWT is used as an authentication token, and it is included and stored in a secure client-side storage (browser cookies ).The server checks the validity of the JWT for each protected endpoint or route to ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to access the resource.
